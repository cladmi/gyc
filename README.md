Wrapper around text editor to add edited configuration files in a git repository.


Features reflexion
------------------

* creation command
* Keep the file hierarchy
* Use the same repository in different computers
    * -> maybe use different branches (enough ?)
* Work even run with sudo
    * -> I still don't know
* how to manage the file if it is different from the one in the repository ?
* possibility to quit and discard the changes
    * -> validate the modifications "add to git repo ?", "restore file"
    * copy the original file in the git repository before editing
* when to pull for news ?
* when to push ? everytime ?
* write permissions:
    * Should belong the regular user
* simply add file

* Really need a wrapper around text editor ? or only around git ?
